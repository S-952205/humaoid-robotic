# Research Findings: Docusaurus Site Implementation

## Docusaurus v3 Docs Setup Best Practices

**Decision**: Use Docusaurus v3 with a multi-instance configuration if needed, although for this project, a single docs instance with a well-structured `docs/` directory and `sidebars.js` should suffice.

**Rationale**: Organizing `docs/` by modules and using `sidebars.js` to define distinct sidebar objects for each section is a standard and effective approach for multi-module projects. Autogenerated sidebars can simplify maintenance. Linking sidebars to the navbar in `docusaurus.config.js` provides clear navigation.

**Alternatives considered**: While multi-instance configurations are available, they introduce additional complexity that is not strictly necessary for the current scope of 4 modules. A single docs instance with careful organization will be more maintainable.

## GitHub Pages Deployment Best Practices

**Decision**: Deploy the Docusaurus site to GitHub Pages using a CI/CD workflow (GitHub Actions) for automation.

**Rationale**: Configuring `baseUrl` in `docusaurus.config.js` correctly is crucial for asset linking. Using a `CNAME` file in the `static/` directory enables custom domains. Automating deployment with GitHub Actions ensures that the site is built and deployed on every push to the source branch, using the `docusaurus deploy` command or a custom script.

**Alternatives considered**: Manual deployment is an option but is prone to errors and less efficient. Other hosting providers were not considered as GitHub Pages was specified.
