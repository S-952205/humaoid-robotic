# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive course book on **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**! This course is designed to guide you through the fundamental concepts, practical applications, and advanced techniques in building and controlling humanoid robots.

## Course Overview

This course combines theoretical foundations with hands-on simulation-based learning, enabling you to understand and implement physical AI systems without requiring expensive hardware. You'll learn through:

- **Simulation-First Approach**: Use industry-standard tools like Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac
- **ROS 2 Integration**: Master the Robot Operating System 2 as your robot's "nervous system"
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models**: Implement cutting-edge AI for robot control
- **Practical Examples**: Every concept comes with working code examples

## What You'll Learn

### Module 1: Physical AI & Humanoid Basics
Understanding the foundations of physical AI, humanoid robot design, and key concepts.

### Module 2: ROS 2 Fundamentals
Master ROS 2 as the central communication framework for robot systems.

### Module 3: Robot Simulation
Explore different simulation platforms (Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac).

### Module 4: NVIDIA Isaac Simulation
Deep dive into NVIDIA's advanced robotics simulation platform.

### Module 5: Vision-Language-Action Models
Implement state-of-the-art AI models for robot control via natural language.

### Capstone Project
Integrate everything you've learned into a complete, working humanoid robot system.

### Hardware Guide
Understand the recommended hardware components for real-world deployment.
