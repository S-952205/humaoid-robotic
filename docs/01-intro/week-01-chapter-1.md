# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

## Overview
Physical AI is the intersection of artificial intelligence and the physical world. This chapter introduces you to the fundamental concepts of physical AI and why it matters for humanoid robotics.

## Key Concepts
- **Physical AI**: AI systems that can perceive and act in the real world
- **Embodied AI**: Intelligence that emerges from interaction with the environment
- **Humanoid Robots**: Robots designed to interact with human environments

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this chapter, you will understand:
1. What physical AI is and how it differs from traditional AI
2. The role of sensors and actuators in physical systems
3. Basic building blocks of humanoid robotics

## Content Coming Soon
This chapter will cover practical examples and code samples to help you understand physical AI concepts.

## Code Example
```python
# Basic physical AI concept
class PhysicalAIAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sensors = []
        self.actuators = []

    def perceive(self):
        # Collect sensor data
        pass

    def act(self):
        # Execute actions through actuators
        pass
```

## Next Steps
- Review the core concepts
- Explore the code examples
- Move to Chapter 2: Humanoid Robotics Basics
