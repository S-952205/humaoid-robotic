Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Book**! 🤖

We're excited to launch this comprehensive course designed to teach you everything you need to know about building and controlling humanoid robots, all through simulation-first learning.

## What to Expect

This course is structured to take you from complete beginner to capable roboticist in 13 weeks. Whether you're interested in robotics as a hobby or career, this course provides:

- **Beginner-friendly content** - No advanced math or hardware assembly required
- **Hands-on simulation** - Learn with Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac
- **Real ROS 2 code** - Every concept comes with working examples
- **Practical projects** - Build toward a complete capstone project

## Course Structure

### Module 1: Physical AI & Humanoid Basics (Weeks 1-2)
Learn the fundamentals of physical AI and humanoid robot design. Understand the basic concepts that underpin modern robotics.

### Module 2: ROS 2 Fundamentals (Weeks 3-4)
Master ROS 2 as the central "nervous system" of any robot. Learn how nodes communicate, manage data flow, and coordinate complex behaviors.

### Module 3: Robot Simulation (Weeks 5-6)
Explore three major simulation platforms and learn how to launch and interact with virtual robots in realistic environments.

### Module 4: NVIDIA Isaac Simulation (Weeks 7-8)
Deep dive into NVIDIA's professional-grade simulation platform for advanced robotics development.

### Module 5: Vision-Language-Action Models (Weeks 9-10)
Implement cutting-edge AI to control robots via natural language. This is where modern robotics is headed!

### Capstone Project (Weeks 11-13)
Integrate everything you've learned into one complete project: Build a robot that understands and executes voice commands.
