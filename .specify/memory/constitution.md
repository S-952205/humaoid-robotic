# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### Beginner-friendly English
All content must be written in clear, concise, and beginner-friendly English, avoiding overly technical jargon where possible.

### Simulation-first
The book prioritizes simulation-based learning using ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA (Vision-Language-Action models) for practical examples.

### Practical Code Examples and Diagrams
Each chapter must include practical, working code examples and illustrative diagrams to aid understanding.

### Accurate, Verified Technical Content
All technical content, including code and explanations, must be accurate and thoroughly verified.

### Docusaurus-compatible Markdown
The entire book must be authored in Markdown compatible with Docusaurus for seamless deployment and rendering.

### Clear Chapter Structure
Chapters should have a clear, logical, and easy-to-navigate structure.

## Constraints

*   No hardware assembly required for examples or exercises.
*   No advanced mathematical concepts are assumed or required.
*   All robotics examples and discussions must exclusively use ROS 2.

## Success Criteria

*   The complete book must be deployable on GitHub Pages.
*   The book must be clear, accurate, and easy to navigate for readers.
*   All simulation code examples provided must be working and verifiable.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other project practices.
Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan.
All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
Complexity must be justified and adhere to the principle of smallest viable change.
